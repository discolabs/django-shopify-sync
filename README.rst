===================
Django Shopify Sync
===================

This package provides a common pattern we used at Disco to synchronise Django models
with their Shopify equivalents.

This package was written for a series of Django 1.7 applications that are no longer
maintained, so we no longer actively maintain this repository (if you're interested
in taking over, feel free to ping us and we can provide commit rights).
